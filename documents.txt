search engine indexing collects parses and stores data to facilitate fast and accurate information retrieval index design incorporates interdisciplinary concepts from linguistics cognitive psychology mathematics informatics and computer science an alternate name for the process in the context of search engines designed to find web pages on the internet is web indexing popular engines focus on the full text indexing of online natural language documents media types such as video and audio and graphics are also searchable meta search engines reuse the indices of other services and do not store a local index whereas cache based search engines permanently store the index along with the corpus unlike full text indices partial text services restrict the depth indexed to reduce index size larger services typically perform indexing at a predetermined time interval due to the required time and processing costs while agent based search engines index in real time
compound term processing refers to a category of techniques used in information retrieval applications to perform matching on the basis of compound terms compound terms are built by combining two or more simple terms for example triple is a single word term but triple heart bypass is a compound term compound term processing is a new approach to an old problem how can one improve the relevance of search results while maintaining ease of use using this technique a search for survival rates following a triple heart bypass in elderly people will locate documents about this topic even if this precise phrase is not contained in any document this can be performed by a concept search which itself uses compound term processing this will extract the key concepts automatically in this case survival rates triple heart bypass and elderly people and use these concepts to select the most relevant documents
the bag of words model is a simplifying representation used in natural language processing and information retrieval ir in this model a text such as a sentence or a document is represented as the bag multiset of its words disregarding grammar and even word order but keeping multiplicity the bag of words model has also been used for computer vision the bag of words model is commonly used in methods of document classification where the frequency of occurrence of each word is used as a feature for training a classifier an early reference to bag of words in a linguistic context can be found in zellig harris s 1954 article on distributional structure
cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them the cosine of 0 is 1 and it is less than 1 for any other angle it is thus a judgment of orientation and not magnitude two vectors with the same orientation have a cosine similarity of 1 two vectors at 90 have a similarity of 0 and two vectors diametrically opposed have a similarity of 1 independent of their magnitude cosine similarity is particularly used in positive space where the outcome is neatly bounded in 0 1 the name derives from the term direction cosine in this case note that unit vectors are maximally similar if they re parallel and maximally dissimilar if they re orthogonal perpendicular this is analogous to the cosine which is unity maximum value when the segments subtend a zero angle and zero uncorrelated when the segments are perpendicular note that these bounds apply for any number of dimensions and cosine similarity is most commonly used in high dimensional positive spaces for example in information retrieval and text mining each term is notionally assigned a different dimension and a document is characterised by a vector where the value of each dimension corresponds to the number of times that term appears in the document cosine similarity then gives a useful measure of how similar two documents are likely to be in terms of their subject matter the technique is also used to measure cohesion within clusters in the field of data mining cosine distance is a term often used for the complement in positive space that is d c a b 1 s c a b displaystyle d c a b 1 s c a b where d c displaystyle d c is the cosine distance and s c displaystyle s c is the cosine similarity it is important to note however that this is not a proper distance metric as it does not have the triangle inequality property or more formally the schwarz inequality and it violates the coincidence axiom to repair the triangle inequality property while maintaining the same ordering it is necessary to convert to angular distance see below one of the reasons for the popularity of cosine similarity is that it is very efficient to evaluate especially for sparse vectors as only the non zero dimensions need to be considered

the curse of dimensionality refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high dimensional spaces often with hundreds or thousands of dimensions that do not occur in low dimensional settings such as the three dimensional physical space of everyday experience the expression was coined by richard e bellman when considering problems in dynamic optimization there are multiple phenomena referred to by this name in domains such as numerical analysis sampling combinatorics machine learning data mining and databases the common theme of these problems is that when the dimensionality increases the volume of the space increases so fast that the available data become sparse this sparsity is problematic for any method that requires statistical significance in order to obtain a statistically sound and reliable result the amount of data needed to support the result often grows exponentially with the dimensionality also organizing and searching data often relies on detecting areas where objects form groups with similar properties in high dimensional data however all objects appear to be sparse and dissimilar in many ways which prevents common data organization strategies from being efficient
in mathematics the dot product or scalar product is an algebraic operation that takes two equal length sequences of numbers usually coordinate vectors and returns a single number in euclidean geometry the dot product of the cartesian coordinates of two vectors is widely used and often called inner product or rarely projection product see also inner product space algebraically the dot product is the sum of the products of the corresponding entries of the two sequences of numbers geometrically it is the product of the euclidean magnitudes of the two vectors and the cosine of the angle between them these definitions are equivalent when using cartesian coordinates in modern geometry euclidean spaces are often defined by using vector spaces in this case the dot product is used for defining lengths the length of a vector is the square root of the dot product of the vector by itself and angles the cosine of the angle of two vectors is the quotient of their dot product by the product of their lengths the name dot product is derived from the centered dot that is often used to designate this operation the alternative name scalar product emphasizes that the result is a scalar rather than a vector which is the case for the vector product in three dimensional space
a conceptual space is a geometric structure that represents a number of quality dimensions which denote basic features by which concepts and objects can be compared as such as weight color taste temperature pitch and the three ordinary spatial dimensions in a conceptual space points denote objects and regions denote concepts the theory of conceptual spaces is a theory about concept learning first proposed by peter g rdenfors it is motivated by notions such as conceptual similarity and prototype theory the theory also puts forward the notion that natural categories are convex regions in conceptual spaces in that if x displaystyle x and y displaystyle y are elements of a category and if z displaystyle z is between x displaystyle x and y displaystyle y then z displaystyle z is also likely to belong to the category the notion of concept convexity allow the interpretation of the focal points of regions as category prototypes in the more general formulations of the theory concepts are defined in terms conceptual similarity to their prototypes
in mathematics the dimension of a vector space v is the cardinality i e the number of vectors of a basis of v over its base field it is sometimes called hamel dimension after georg hamel or algebraic dimension to distinguish it from other types of dimension for every vector space there exists a basis and all bases of a vector space have equal cardinality as a result the dimension of a vector space is uniquely defined we say v is finite dimensional if the dimension of v is finite and infinite dimensional if its dimension is infinite the dimension of the vector space v over the field f can be written as dimf v or as v f read dimension of v over f when f can be inferred from context dim v is typically written
apache ant is a software tool for automating software build processes which originated from the apache tomcat project in early 2000 it was a replacement for the unix make build tool and was created due to a number of problems with unix s make it is similar to make but is implemented using the java language requires the java platform and is best suited to building java projects the most immediately noticeable difference between ant and make is that ant uses xml to describe the build process and its dependencies whereas make uses makefile format by default the xml file is named build xml ant is an apache software foundation project it is open source software and is released under the apache license

in linear algebra an eigenvector or characteristic vector of a linear transformation is a non zero vector that only changes by an overall scale when that linear transformation is applied to it more formally if t is a linear transformation from a vector space v over a field f into itself and v is a vector in v that is not the zero vector then v is an eigenvector of t if t v is a scalar multiple of v this condition can be written as the equation t v v displaystyle t mathbf v lambda mathbf v where is a scalar in the field f known as the eigenvalue characteristic value or characteristic root associated with the eigenvector v if the vector space v is finite dimensional then the linear transformation t can be represented as a square matrix a and the vector v by a column vector rendering the above mapping as a matrix multiplication on the left hand side and a scaling of the column vector on the right hand side in the equation a v v displaystyle a mathbf v lambda mathbf v there is a correspondence between n by n square matrices and linear transformations from an n dimensional vector space to itself for this reason it is equivalent to define eigenvalues and eigenvectors using either the language of matrices or the language of linear transformations geometrically an eigenvector corresponding to a real nonzero eigenvalue points in a direction that is stretched by the transformation and the eigenvalue is the factor by which it is stretched if the eigenvalue is negative the direction is reversed

in mathematics physics and engineering a euclidean vector sometimes called a geometric or spatial vector or as here simply a vector is a geometric object that has magnitude or length and direction vectors can be added to other vectors according to vector algebra a euclidean vector is frequently represented by a line segment with a definite direction or graphically as an arrow connecting an initial point a with a terminal point b and denoted by a b displaystyle overrightarrow ab a vector is what is needed to carry the point a to the point b the latin word vector means carrier it was first used by 18th century astronomers investigating planet rotation around the sun the magnitude of the vector is the distance between the two points and the direction refers to the direction of displacement from a to b many algebraic operations on real numbers such as addition subtraction multiplication and negation have close analogues for vectors operations which obey the familiar algebraic laws of commutativity associativity and distributivity these operations and associated laws qualify euclidean vectors as an example of the more generalized concept of vectors defined simply as elements of a vector space vectors play an important role in physics the velocity and acceleration of a moving object and the forces acting on it can all be described with vectors many other physical quantities can be usefully thought of as vectors although most of them do not represent distances except for example position or displacement their magnitude and direction can still be represented by the length and direction of an arrow the mathematical representation of a physical vector depends on the coordinate system used to describe it other vector like objects that describe physical quantities and transform in a similar way under changes of the coordinate system include pseudovectors and tensors

bayesian probability is an interpretation of the concept of probability in which instead of frequency or propensity of some phenomenon probability is interpreted as reasonable expectation representing a state of knowledge or as quantification of a personal belief the bayesian interpretation of probability can be seen as an extension of propositional logic that enables reasoning with hypotheses i e the propositions whose truth or falsity is uncertain in the bayesian view a probability is assigned to a hypothesis whereas under frequentist inference a hypothesis is typically tested without being assigned a probability bayesian probability belongs to the category of evidential probabilities to evaluate the probability of a hypothesis the bayesian probabilist specifies some prior probability which is then updated to a posterior probability in the light of new relevant data evidence the bayesian interpretation provides a standard set of procedures and formulae to perform this calculation the term bayesian derives from the 18th century mathematician and theologian thomas bayes who provided the first mathematical treatment of a non trivial problem of bayesian inference mathematician pierre simon laplace pioneered and popularised what is now called bayesian probability broadly speaking there are two views on bayesian probability that interpret the probability concept in different ways according to the objectivist view probability is a reasonable expectation that represents the state of knowledge can be interpreted as an extension of logic and its rules can be justified by cox s theorem according to the subjectivist view probability quantifies a personal belief and its rules can be justified by requirements of rationality and coherence following from the dutch book argument or from the decision theory and de finetti s theorem
in mathematics a combinatorial explosion is the rapid growth of the complexity of a problem due to how the combinatorics of the problem is affected by the input constraints and bounds of the problem combinatorial explosion is sometimes used to justify the intractability of certain problems examples of such problems include certain mathematical functions the analysis of some puzzles and games and some pathological examples which can be modelled as the ackermann function

in physics and mathematics the dimension of a mathematical space or object is informally defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within it thus a line has a dimension of one because only one coordinate is needed to specify a point on it for example the point at 5 on a number line a surface such as a plane or the surface of a cylinder or sphere has a dimension of two because two coordinates are needed to specify a point on it for example both a latitude and longitude are required to locate a point on the surface of a sphere the inside of a cube a cylinder or a sphere is three dimensional because three coordinates are needed to locate a point within these spaces in classical mechanics space and time are different categories and refer to absolute space and time that conception of the world is a four dimensional space but not the one that was found necessary to describe electromagnetism the four dimensions of spacetime consist of events that are not absolutely defined spatially and temporally but rather are known relative to the motion of an observer minkowski space first approximates the universe without gravity the pseudo riemannian manifolds of general relativity describe spacetime with matter and gravity ten dimensions are used to describe string theory eleven dimensions can describe supergravity and m theory and the state space of quantum mechanics is an infinite dimensional function space the concept of dimension is not restricted to physical objects high dimensional spaces frequently occur in mathematics and the sciences they may be parameter spaces or configuration spaces such as in lagrangian or hamiltonian mechanics these are abstract spaces independent of the physical space we live in

a complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form a bi where a and b are real numbers and i is a solution of the equation x2 1 which is called an imaginary number because there is no real number that satisfies this equation for the complex number a bi a is called the real part and b is called the imaginary part despite the historical nomenclature imaginary complex numbers are regarded in the mathematical sciences as just as real as the real numbers and are fundamental in many aspects of our description of the natural world the complex number system can be defined as the algebraic extension of the ordinary real numbers by an imaginary number i this means that complex numbers can be added subtracted and multiplied as polynomials in the variable i with the rule i2 1 imposed furthermore complex numbers can also be divided by nonzero complex numbers overall the complex number system is a field most importantly the complex numbers give rise to the fundamental theorem of algebra every non constant polynomial equation with complex coefficients has a complex solution this property is true of the complex numbers but not the reals the 16th century italian mathematician gerolamo cardano is credited with introducing complex numbers in his attempts to find solutions to cubic equations geometrically complex numbers extend the concept of the one dimensional number line to the two dimensional complex plane by using the horizontal axis for the real part and the vertical axis for the imaginary part the complex number a bi can be identified with the point a b in the complex plane a complex number whose real part is zero is said to be purely imaginary the points for these numbers lie on the vertical axis of the complex plane a complex number whose imaginary part is zero can be viewed as a real number its point lies on the horizontal axis of the complex plane complex numbers can also be represented in polar form which associates each complex number with its distance from the origin its magnitude and with a particular angle known as the argument of this complex number
face space is a theoretical idea in psychology such that it is a multidimensional space in which recognisable faces are stored the representation of faces within this space are according to invariant features of the face itself however recently was theoretically demonstrated that faces can be stored in the face space according to their dynamic features as well and that in this case the resulting space exhibits a twofold structure the face space is useful for accounting various aspects of face recognition including distinctiveness the own race bias and caricature effects the face space framework has been cited in almost 1000 scientific articles and it was recently revisited in a special edition of the journal quarterly journal of experimental psychology featuring the top 10 ideas that have appeared in the journal s pages

a communication channel or simply channel refers either to a physical transmission medium such as a wire or to a logical connection over a multiplexed medium such as a radio channel in telecommunications and computer networking a channel is used to convey an information signal for example a digital bit stream from one or several senders or transmitters to one or several receivers a channel has a certain capacity for transmitting information often measured by its bandwidth in hz or its data rate in bits per second communicating data from one location to another requires some form of pathway or medium these pathways called communication channels use two types of media cable twisted pair wire cable and fiber optic cable and broadcast microwave satellite radio and infrared cable or wire line media use physical wires of cables to transmit data and information twisted pair wire and coaxial cables are made of copper and fiber optic cable is made of glass in information theory a channel refers to a theoretical channel model with certain error characteristics in this more general view a storage device is also a kind of channel which can be sent to written and received from reading
bangalore officially known as bengaluru be u u listen is the capital of the indian state of karnataka it has a population of about 8 42 million and a metropolitan population of about 8 52 million making it the third most populous city and fifth most populous urban agglomeration in india it is located in southern india on the deccan plateau its elevation is over 900 m 3 000 ft above sea level the highest of india s major cities a succession of south indian dynasties the western gangas the cholas and the hoysalas ruled the present region of bangalore until in 1537 ce kemp gowd a feudal ruler under the vijayanagara empire established a mud fort considered to be the foundation of modern bangalore in 1638 the mar th s conquered and ruled bangalore for almost 50 years after which the mughals captured and sold the city to the mysore kingdom of the wadiyar dynasty it was captured by the british after victory in the fourth anglo mysore war 1799 who returned administrative control of the city to the maharaja of mysore the old city developed in the dominions of the maharaja of mysore and was made capital of the princely state of mysore which existed as a nominally sovereign entity of the british raj in 1809 the british shifted their cantonment to bangalore outside the old city and a town grew up around it which was governed as part of british india following india s independence in 1947 bangalore became the capital of mysore state and remained capital when the new indian state of karnataka was formed in 1956 the two urban settlements of bangalore city and cantonment which had developed as independent entities merged into a single urban centre in 1949 the existing kannada name bengal ru was declared the official name of the city in 2006 bangalore is sometimes referred to as the silicon valley of india or it capital of india because of its role as the nation s leading information technology it exporter indian technological organisations isro infosys wipro and hal are headquartered in the city a demographically diverse city bangalore is the second fastest growing major metropolis in india it is home to many educational and research institutions in india such as indian institute of science iisc indian institute of management bangalore iimb national institute of fashion technology bangalore national institute of design bangalore nid r d campus national law school of india university nlsiu and national institute of mental health and neurosciences nimhans numerous state owned aerospace and defence organisations such as bharat electronics hindustan aeronautics and national aerospace laboratories are located in the city the city also houses the kannada film industry
in physics angular momentum rarely moment of momentum or rotational momentum is the rotational comparison to linear momentum it is an important quantity in physics because it is a conserved quantity the angular momentum of a system remains constant unless acted on by an external torque the definition of angular momentum for a point particle is a pseudovector r p the cross product of the particle s position vector r relative to some origin and its momentum vector p mv this definition can be applied to each point in continua like solids or fluids or physical fields unlike momentum angular momentum does depend on where the origin is chosen since the particle s position is measured from it the angular momentum of an object can also be connected to the angular velocity of the object how fast it rotates about an axis via the moment of inertia i which depends on the shape and distribution of mass about the axis of rotation however while always points in the direction of the rotation axis the angular momentum l may point in a different direction depending on how the mass is distributed angular momentum is additive the total angular momentum of a system is the pseudo vector sum of the angular momenta for continua or fields one uses integration the total angular momentum of anything can always be split into the sum of two main components orbital angular momentum about an axis outside the object plus spin angular momentum through the centre of mass of the object torque can be defined as the rate of change of angular momentum analogous to force the conservation of angular momentum helps explain many observed phenomena for example the increase in rotational speed of a spinning figure skater as the skater s arms are contracted the high rotational rates of neutron stars the falling cat problem and precession of tops and gyros applications include the gyrocompass control moment gyroscope inertial guidance systems reaction wheels flying discs or frisbees and earth s rotation to name a few in general conservation does limit the possible motion of a system but does not uniquely determine what the exact motion is in quantum mechanics angular momentum is an operator with quantized eigenvalues angular momentum is subject to the heisenberg uncertainty principle meaning that only one component can be measured with definite precision the other two cannot also the spin of elementary particles does not correspond to literal spinning motion

the united states census of 1870 was the ninth united states census conducted by the census bureau in june 1870 the 1870 census was the first census to provide detailed information on the black population only years after the culmination of the civil war when slaves were granted freedom the population was said to be 38 555 983 individuals a 22 62 increase since 1860 the 1870 census population estimate is controversial as many believed it underestimated the true population numbers especially in new york and pennsylvania
the united states census of 1860 was the eighth census conducted in the united states starting june 1 1860 and lasting five months it determined the population of the united states to be 31 443 321 an increase of 35 4 percent over the 23 191 875 persons enumerated during the 1850 census the total population included 3 953 761 slaves representing 12 6 of the total population by the time the 1860 census returns were ready for tabulation the nation was sinking into the american civil war as a result census superintendent joseph c g kennedy and his staff produced only an abbreviated set of public reports without graphic or cartographic representations the statistics did allow the census staff to produce a cartographic display including preparing maps of southern states for union field commanders these maps displayed militarily vital topics including white population slave population predominant agricultural products by county and rail and post road transportation routes
in physics angular frequency also referred to by the terms angular speed radial frequency circular frequency orbital frequency radian frequency and pulsatance is a scalar measure of rotation rate it refers to the angular displacement per unit time e g in rotation or the rate of change of the phase of a sinusoidal waveform e g in oscillations and waves or as the rate of change of the argument of the sine function angular frequency or angular speed is the magnitude of the vector quantity angular velocity the term angular frequency vector displaystyle vec omega is sometimes used as a synonym for the vector quantity angular velocity one revolution is equal to 2 radians hence 2 t 2 f displaystyle omega 2 pi over t 2 pi f where is the angular frequency or angular speed measured in radians per second t is the period measured in seconds f is the ordinary frequency measured in hertz sometimes symbolised with

substitution is a different way of handling templates than normally done on wikipedia usually templates are transcluded which means that if the template changes every page that uses it will update to comply with the change in question this is the procedure used for most templates however some templates are instead substituted this means that if the template changes the page that uses it will not and will continue to show the old version of the template some templates should always be substituted while most should always be transcluded to substitute add subst after the opening braces as in subst page name for example substitution subst medicine in contrast to transclusion medicine the contents of template medicine will be expanded for any templates and stored at each point where subst medicine is placed in a page note that ref tags refuse to run subst unless temporarily renamed as xref name xx or similar this page also lists templates that should either always or never be substituted except in the wikipedia namespace automated tools a k a bots that do such replacements will never be used on the original template if you are going to use a bot to substitute templates please read through the talk page first as many are under dispute or change status over time and substitution is permanent

angular displacement of a body is the angle in radians degrees revolutions through which a point or line has been rotated in a specified sense about a specified axis when an object rotates about its axis the motion cannot simply be analyzed as a particle since in circular motion it undergoes a changing velocity and acceleration at any time t when dealing with the rotation of an object it becomes simpler to consider the body itself rigid a body is generally considered rigid when the separations between all the particles remains constant throughout the objects motion so for example parts of its mass are not flying off in a realistic sense all things can be deformable however this impact is minimal and negligible thus the rotation of a rigid body over a fixed axis is referred to as rotational motion
in mathematics the additive identity of a set which is equipped with the operation of addition is an element which when added to any element x in the set yields x one of the most familiar additive identities is the number 0 from elementary mathematics but additive identities occur in other mathematical structures where addition is defined such as in groups and rings
initialisms and acronyms are abbreviations consisting of the initials of words in a phrase however initialisms are spoken as individual letters whereas acronyms are pronounced as normal words
in mathematics the additive inverse of a number a is the number that when added to a yields zero this number is also known as the opposite number sign change and negation for a real number it reverses its sign the opposite to a positive number is negative and the opposite to a negative number is positive zero is the additive inverse of itself the additive inverse of a is denoted by unary minus a see the discussion below for example the additive inverse of 7 is 7 because 7 7 0 and the additive inverse of 0 3 is 0 3 because 0 3 0 3 0 the additive inverse is defined as its inverse element under the binary operation of addition see the discussion below which allows a broad generalization to mathematical objects other than numbers as for any inverse operation double additive inverse has no net effect x x
an additive group is a group of which the group operation is to be thought of as addition in some sense it is usually abelian and typically written using the symbol for its binary operation this terminology is widely used with structures equipped with several operations for specifying the structure obtained by forgetting the other operations examples include the additive group of the integers of a vector space and of a ring this is particularly useful with rings and fields to distinguish the additive underlying group from the multiplicative group of the invertible elements

the eleventh united states census was taken beginning june 2 1890 it determined the resident population of the united states to be 62 979 766 an increase of 25 5 percent over the 50 189 209 persons enumerated during the 1880 census the data was tabulated by machine for the first time the data reported that the distribution of the population had resulted in the disappearance of the american frontier most of the 1890 census materials were destroyed in a 1921 fire and fragments of the us census population schedule exist only for the states of alabama georgia illinois minnesota new jersey new york north carolina ohio south dakota and texas and the district of columbia
an analog signal is any continuous signal for which the time varying feature variable of the signal is a representation of some other time varying quantity i e analogous to another time varying signal for example in an analog audio signal the instantaneous voltage of the signal varies continuously with the pressure of the sound waves it differs from a digital signal in which the continuous quantity is a representation of a sequence of discrete values which can only take on one of a finite number of values the term analog signal usually refers to electrical signals however mechanical pneumatic hydraulic human speech and other systems may also convey or be considered analog signals an analog signal uses some property of the medium to convey the signal s information for example an aneroid barometer uses rotary position as the signal to convey pressure information in an electrical signal the voltage current or frequency of the signal may be varied to represent the information any information may be conveyed by an analog signal often such a signal is a measured response to changes in physical phenomena such as sound light temperature position or pressure the physical variable is converted to an analog signal by a transducer for example in sound recording fluctuations in air pressure that is to say sound strike the diaphragm of a microphone which induces corresponding fluctuations in the current produced by a coil in an electromagnetic microphone or the voltage produced by a condenser microphone the voltage or the current is said to be an analog of the sound an analog signal has a theoretically infinite resolution in practice an analog signal is subject to electronic noise and distortion introduced by communication channels and signal processing operations which can progressively degrade the signal to noise ratio snr in contrast digital signals have a finite resolution converting an analog signal to digital form introduces a constant low level noise called quantization noise into the signal which determines the noise floor but once in digital form the signal can in general be processed or transmitted without introducing additional noise or distortion in analog systems it is difficult to detect when such degradation occurs however in digital systems degradation can not only be detected but corrected as well
an amphitheatre or amphitheater is an open air venue used for entertainment performances and sports the term derives from the ancient greek amphitheatron from amphi meaning on both sides or around and th tron meaning place for viewing ancient roman amphitheatres were oval or circular in plan with seating tiers that surrounded the central performance area like a modern open air stadium in contrast both ancient greek and ancient roman theatres were built in a semicircle with tiered seating rising on one side of the performance area in modern usage an amphitheatre is theatre style stages with spectator seating on only one side theatres in the round and stadia natural formations of similar shape are sometimes known as natural amphitheatres

the terms a side and b side refer to the two sides of 78 45 and 33 1 3 rpm phonograph records whether singles extended plays eps or long playing lp records the a side usually featured the recording that the artist record producer or the record company intended to receive the initial promotional effort and then receive radio airplay hopefully to become a hit record the b side or flip side is a secondary recording that has a history of its own some artists released b sides that were considered as strong as the a side and became hits in their own right others took the opposite approach producer phil spector was in the habit of filling b sides with on the spot instrumentals that no one would confuse with the a side with this practice spector was assured that airplay was focused on the side he wanted to be the hit side music recordings have moved away from records onto other formats such as cds and digital downloads which do not have sides but the terms are still used to describe the type of content with b side sometimes standing for bonus track

in mathematics and more specifically in abstract algebra an algebraic structure is a set called carrier set or underlying set with one or more finitary operations defined on it that satisfies a list of axioms examples of algebraic structures include groups rings fields and lattices more complex structures can be defined by introducing multiple operations different underlying sets or by altering the defining axioms examples of more complex algebraic structures include vector spaces modules and algebras the properties of specific algebraic structures are studied in abstract algebra the general theory of algebraic structures has been formalized in universal algebra the language of category theory is used to express and study relationships between different classes of algebraic and non algebraic objects this is because it is sometimes possible to find strong connections between some classes of objects sometimes of different kinds for example galois theory establishes a connection between certain fields and groups two algebraic structures of different kinds

chemistry is the scientific discipline involved with compounds composed of atoms i e elements and molecules i e combinations of atoms their composition structure properties behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other compounds chemistry addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via chemical bonds to form new chemical compounds there are four types of chemical bonds covalent bonds in which compounds share one or more electron s ionic bonds in which a compound donates one or more electrons to another compound to produce ions cations and anions hydrogen bonds and van der waals force bonds chemistry occupies an intermediate position in a hierarchy of the sciences by reductive level between physics and biology it is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level examples include plant chemistry botany the formation of igneous rocks geology how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded ecology the properties of the soil on the moon astrophysics how medications work pharmacology and how to collect dna evidence at a crime scene forensics the history of chemistry represents a time span from ancient history to the present by 1000 bc civilizations used technologies that would eventually form the basis of the various branches of chemistry examples include extracting metals from ores making pottery and glazes fermenting beer and wine extracting chemicals from plants for medicine and perfume rendering fat into soap making glass and making alloys like bronze the protoscience of chemistry alchemy was unsuccessful in explaining the nature of matter and its transformations however by performing experiments and recording the results alchemists set the stage for modern chemistry the distinction began to emerge when a clear differentiation was made between chemistry and alchemy by robert boyle in his work the sceptical chymist 1661 while both alchemy and chemistry are concerned with matter and its transformations chemists are seen as applying scientific method to their work chemistry is considered to have become an established science with the work of antoine lavoisier who developed a law of conservation of mass that demanded careful measurement and quantitative observations of chemical phenomena the history of chemistry is intertwined with the history of thermodynamics especially through the work of willard gibbs chemistry was preceded by its protoscience alchemy which is an intuitive but non scientific approach to understanding the elements compounds and their interactions it was unsuccessful in explaining the nature of matter and its transformations but by performing experiments and recording the results alchemists set the stage for modern chemistry the distinction began to emerge when a clear differentiation between alchemy and chemistry was made by robert boyle in 1661 the application of the scientific method in chemistry was the crucial difference

in mathematics an antimatroid is a formal system that describes processes in which a set is built up by including elements one at a time and in which an element once available for inclusion remains available until it is included antimatroids are commonly axiomatized in two equivalent ways either as a set system modeling the possible states of such a process or as a formal language modeling the different sequences in which elements may be included dilworth 1940 was the first to study antimatroids using yet another axiomatization based on lattice theory and they have been frequently rediscovered in other contexts see korte et al 1991 for a comprehensive survey of antimatroid theory with many additional references the axioms defining antimatroids as set systems are very similar to those of matroids but whereas matroids are defined by an exchange axiom e g the basis exchange or independent set exchange axioms antimatroids are defined instead by an anti exchange axiom from which their name derives antimatroids can be viewed as a special case of greedoids and of semimodular lattices and as a generalization of partial orders and of distributive lattices antimatroids are equivalent by complementation to convex geometries a combinatorial abstraction of convex sets in geometry antimatroids have been applied to model precedence constraints in scheduling problems potential event sequences in simulations task planning in artificial intelligence and the states of knowledge of human learners

algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics classically studying zeros of multivariate polynomials modern algebraic geometry is based on the use of abstract algebraic techniques mainly from commutative algebra for solving geometrical problems about these sets of zeros the fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry are algebraic varieties which are geometric manifestations of solutions of systems of polynomial equations examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are plane algebraic curves which include lines circles parabolas ellipses hyperbolas cubic curves like elliptic curves and quartic curves like lemniscates and cassini ovals a point of the plane belongs to an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy a given polynomial equation basic questions involve the study of the points of special interest like the singular points the inflection points and the points at infinity more advanced questions involve the topology of the curve and relations between the curves given by different equations algebraic geometry occupies a central place in modern mathematics and has multiple conceptual connections with such diverse fields as complex analysis topology and number theory initially a study of systems of polynomial equations in several variables the subject of algebraic geometry starts where equation solving leaves off and it becomes even more important to understand the intrinsic properties of the totality of solutions of a system of equations than to find a specific solution this leads into some of the deepest areas in all of mathematics both conceptually and in terms of technique in the 20th century algebraic geometry split into several subareas the mainstream of algebraic geometry is devoted to the study of the complex points of the algebraic varieties and more generally to the points with coordinates in an algebraically closed field the study of the points of an algebraic variety with coordinates in the field of the rational numbers or in a number field became arithmetic geometry or more classically diophantine geometry a subfield of algebraic number theory the study of the real points of an algebraic variety is the subject of real algebraic geometry a large part of singularity theory is devoted to the singularities of algebraic varieties with the rise of the computers a computational algebraic geometry area has emerged which lies at the intersection of algebraic geometry and computer algebra it consists essentially in developing algorithms and software for studying and finding the properties of explicitly given algebraic varieties much of the development of the mainstream of algebraic geometry in the 20th century occurred within an abstract algebraic framework with increasing emphasis being placed on intrinsic properties of algebraic varieties not dependent on any particular way of embedding the variety in an ambient coordinate space this parallels developments in topology differential and complex geometry one key achievement of this abstract algebraic geometry is grothendieck s scheme theory which allows one to use sheaf theory to study algebraic varieties in a way which is very similar to its use in the study of differential and analytic manifolds this is obtained by extending the notion of point in classical algebraic geometry a point of an affine variety may be identified through hilbert s nullstellensatz with a maximal ideal of the coordinate ring while the points of the corresponding affine scheme are all prime ideals of this ring this means that a point of such a scheme may be either a usual point or a subvariety this approach also enables a unification of the language and the tools of classical algebraic geometry mainly concerned with complex points and of algebraic number theory wiles s proof of the longstanding conjecture called fermat s last theorem is an example of the power of this approach

in computing a digital object identifier or doi is a persistent identifier or handle used to uniquely identify objects standardized by the international organization for standardization iso an implementation of the handle system dois are in wide use mainly to identify academic professional and government information such as journal articles research reports and data sets and official publications though they also have been used to identify other types of information resources such as commercial videos a doi aims to be resolvable usually to some form of access to the information object to which the doi refers this is achieved by binding the doi to metadata about the object such as a url indicating where the object can be found thus by being actionable and interoperable a doi differs from identifiers such as isbns and isrcs which aim only to uniquely identify their referents the doi system uses the indecs content model for representing metadata the doi for a document remains fixed over the lifetime of the document whereas its location and other metadata may change referring to an online document by its doi shall provide a more stable linking than simply using its url every time a url changes the publisher has to update the metadata for the doi to link to the new url it is the publisher s responsibility to update the doi database if he fails to do so the doi resolves to a dead link leaving the doi useless the developer and administrator of the doi system is the international doi foundation idf which introduced it in 2000 organizations that meet the contractual obligations of the doi system and are willing to pay to become a member of the system can assign dois the doi system is implemented through a federation of registration agencies coordinated by the idf by late april 2011 more than 50 million doi names had been assigned by some 4 000 organizations and by april 2013 this number had grown to 85 million doi names assigned through 9 500 organizations
algebra from arabic al jabr meaning reunion of broken parts is one of the broad parts of mathematics together with number theory geometry and analysis in its most general form algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics as such it includes everything from elementary equation solving to the study of abstractions such as groups rings and fields the more basic parts of algebra are called elementary algebra the more abstract parts are called abstract algebra or modern algebra elementary algebra is generally considered to be essential for any study of mathematics science or engineering as well as such applications as medicine and economics abstract algebra is a major area in advanced mathematics studied primarily by professional mathematicians elementary algebra differs from arithmetic in the use of abstractions such as using letters to stand for numbers that are either unknown or allowed to take on many values for example in x 2 5 displaystyle x 2 5 the letter x displaystyle x is unknown but the law of inverses can be used to discover its value x 3 displaystyle x 3 in e mc2 the letters e displaystyle e and m displaystyle m are variables and the letter c displaystyle c is a constant the speed of light in a vacuum algebra gives methods for solving equations and expressing formulas that are much easier for those who know how to use them than the older method of writing everything out in words the word algebra is also used in certain specialized ways a special kind of mathematical object in abstract algebra is called an algebra and the word is used for example in the phrases linear algebra and algebraic topology a mathematician who does research in algebra is called an algebraist
the 1975 cricket world cup officially called the prudential cup 75 was the first edition of the cricket world cup organised by the international cricket conference icc and was the first major limited overs one day international odi cricket tournament to be held it was held from 7 to 21 june 1975 in england the tournament was sponsored by prudential assurance company and had eight participating countries the six test playing teams of the time australia england india new zealand pakistan and the west indies plus leading associate nations sri lanka and for the only time east africa the teams were divided into two groups of four with each team playing the other teams in their group once the top two from each group qualified for the semi finals with the winners of these matches meeting in the final each match consisted of 60 overs per team and was played in traditional white clothing and with red balls all were played during the day and hence started early the concept of odi cricket was still in the early stages and in the years between 1971 and 1975 only 18 such matches between the test playing nations had been contested england new zealand west indies and australia were the teams to qualify for the semi finals making this the only world cup thus far in which no team from the indian subcontinent made this stage australia defeated england and the west indies beat new zealand before the west indies the pre tournament favourites defeated australia in the final at lord s by 17 runs to become the first world cup winners the opening match of the tournament featured one of the most bizarre batting efforts in one day history by india s sunil gavaskar after england scored 334 4 with dennis amiss making 137 gavaskar batted through the full 60 overs for 36 not out prompting several pitch invasions from unhappy indian fans

in abstract algebra a boolean algebra or boolean lattice is a complemented distributive lattice this type of algebraic structure captures essential properties of both set operations and logic operations a boolean algebra can be seen as a generalization of a power set algebra or a field of sets or its elements can be viewed as generalized truth values it is also a special case of a de morgan algebra and a kleene algebra with involution every boolean algebra gives rise to a boolean ring and vice versa with ring multiplication corresponding to conjunction or meet and ring addition to exclusive disjunction or symmetric difference not disjunction however the theory of boolean rings has an inherent asymmetry between the two operators while the axioms and theorems of boolean algebra express the symmetry of the theory described by the duality principle
a neologism from greek n o new and l gos speech utterance is a relatively recent or isolated term word or phrase that may be in the process of entering common use but that has not yet been fully accepted into mainstream language neologisms are often directly attributable to a specific person publication period or event in the process of language formation neologisms are more mature than protologisms
a book is a series of pages assembled for easy portability and reading as well as the composition contained in it the most common modern form of book is a codex volume consisting of rectangular paper pages bound on one side with a heavier cover and spine so that it can fan open for reading books have taken other forms such as scrolls leaves on a string or strips tied together and the pages have been of parchment vellum papyrus bamboo slips palm leaves silk wood and other materials the contents of books are also called books as are other compositions of that length for instance aristotle s physics the constituent sections of the bible and even the egyptian book of the dead are called books independently of their physical form conversely some long literary compositions are divided into books of varying sizes which typically do not correspond to physically bound units this tradition derives from ancient scroll formats where long works needed several scrolls where very long books in codex format still need to be physically divided the term volume is now normally used books may be distributed in electronic form as e books and other formats a unesco conference in 1964 attempted to define a book for library purposes as a non periodical printed publication of at least forty nine pages exclusive of cover pages a single sheet within a codex book is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page writing or images can be printed or drawn on a book s pages in library and information science a monograph is a book of one or more volumes which is not a serial such as a magazine journal or newspaper an avid reader or collector of books or a book lover is a bibliophile or colloquially bookworm a shop where books are bought and sold is a bookshop or bookstore books are also sold elsewhere books can also be borrowed from libraries google has estimated that as of 2010 approximately 130 000 000 distinct titles had been published in some wealthier nations the sale of printed books has decreased because of the use of e books though sales of e books declined in the first half of 2015

metadata is data information that provides information about other data three distinct types of metadata exist descriptive metadata structural metadata and administrative metadata descriptive metadata describes a resource for purposes such as discovery and identification it can include elements such as title abstract author and keywords structural metadata is metadata about containers of data and indicates how compound objects are put together for example how pages are ordered to form chapters it describes the types versions relationships and other characteristics of digital materials administrative metadata provides information to help manage a resource such as when and how it was created file type and other technical information and who can access it
automated planning and scheduling sometimes denoted as simply ai planning is a branch of artificial intelligence that concerns the realization of strategies or action sequences typically for execution by intelligent agents autonomous robots and unmanned vehicles unlike classical control and classification problems the solutions are complex and must be discovered and optimized in multidimensional space planning is also related to decision theory in known environments with available models planning can be done offline solutions can be found and evaluated prior to execution in dynamically unknown environments the strategy often needs to be revised online models and policies must be adapted solutions usually resort to iterative trial and error processes commonly seen in artificial intelligence these include dynamic programming reinforcement learning and combinatorial optimization languages used to describe planning and scheduling are often called action languages

this is about lattice theory for other similarly named results see birkhoff s theorem disambiguation in mathematics birkhoff s representation theorem for distributive lattices states that the elements of any finite distributive lattice can be represented as finite sets in such a way that the lattice operations correspond to unions and intersections of sets the theorem can be interpreted as providing a one to one correspondence between distributive lattices and partial orders between quasi ordinal knowledge spaces and preorders or between finite topological spaces and preorders it is named after garrett birkhoff who published a proof of it in 1937 the name birkhoff s representation theorem has also been applied to two other results of birkhoff one from 1935 on the representation of boolean algebras as families of sets closed under union intersection and complement so called fields of sets closely related to the rings of sets used by birkhoff to represent distributive lattices and birkhoff s hsp theorem representing algebras as products of irreducible algebras birkhoff s representation theorem has also been called the fundamental theorem for finite distributive lattices
mediawiki is a free and open source wiki software originally developed by magnus manske and improved by lee daniel crocker it runs on many websites including wikipedia wiktionary and wikimedia commons it is written in the php programming language and stores the contents into a database like wordpress which is based on a similar licensing and architecture it has become the dominant software in its category the first version of the software was deployed to serve the needs of the wikipedia encyclopedia in 2002 wikipedia and other wikimedia foundation projects continue to define a large part of the requirement set for mediawiki the software is optimized to efficiently handle large projects which can have terabytes of content and hundreds of thousands of hits per second because wikipedia is one of the world s largest websites achieving scalability through multiple layers of caching and database replication has been a major concern for developers the software has more than 900 configuration settings and more than 2 000 extensions available for enabling various features to be added or changed on wikipedia alone more than 1000 automated and semi automated bots and other tools have been developed to assist in editing it has also been deployed by some companies as an internal knowledge management system and some educators have assigned students to use mediawiki for collaborative group projects
charles john huffam dickens 7 february 1812 9 june 1870 was an english writer and social critic he created some of the world s best known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the victorian era his works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime and by the 20th century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius his novels and short stories enjoy lasting popularity born in portsmouth dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors prison despite his lack of formal education he edited a weekly journal for 20 years wrote 15 novels five novellas hundreds of short stories and non fiction articles lectured and performed extensively was an indefatigable letter writer and campaigned vigorously for children s rights education and other social reforms dickens s literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of the pickwick papers within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity famous for his humour satire and keen observation of character and society his novels most published in monthly or weekly instalments pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction which became the dominant victorian mode for novel publication the instalment format allowed dickens to evaluate his audience s reaction and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback for example when his wife s chiropodist expressed distress at the way miss mowcher in david copperfield seemed to reflect her disabilities dickens improved the character with positive features his plots were carefully constructed and he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives masses of the illiterate poor chipped in ha pennies to have each new monthly episode read to them opening up and inspiring a new class of readers dickens was regarded as the literary colossus of his age his 1843 novella a christmas carol remains popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre oliver twist and great expectations are also frequently adapted and like many of his novels evoke images of early victorian london his 1859 novel a tale of two cities set in london and paris is his best known work of historical fiction dickens has been praised by fellow writers from leo tolstoy to george orwell and g k chesterton for his realism comedy prose style unique characterisations and social criticism on the other hand oscar wilde henry james and virginia woolf complained of a lack of psychological depth loose writing and a vein of saccharine sentimentalism the term dickensian is used to describe something that is reminiscent of dickens and his writings such as poor social conditions or comically repulsive characters
